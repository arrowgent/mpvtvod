# [mpvtvod](https://github.com/arrowgent/mpvtvod/blob/main/mpvtvod.sh)
simple linux terminal script for twitch: seek latest twitch VOD and open it with Streamlink using MPV <br>

# requirements:
twitch-dl [https://github.com/ihabunek/twitch-dl](https://github.com/ihabunek/twitch-dl)<br>
youtube-dl [https://youtube-dl.org/](https://youtube-dl.org/)<br>
streamlink [https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) <br>
mpv [https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)<br>

# usage
`mpvtvod username` <br>

# extra
included here is an older script for opening a live streams <br>
[mpvtw](https://github.com/arrowgent/mpvtvod/blob/main/mpvtw.sh) <br>
will possibly combine these at somepoint, if i feel like it. -- *now combined with mpvtod*<br>
notes: mpv by itself without streamlink causes a buffering issue where the stream stops playing. <br>
note: im discovering streamlink/mpv configuration matters a lot for the audio buffer problem. YMMV <br>
<br>
[ttv_browser](https://github.com/arrowgent/mpvtvod/blob/main/ttv_brower.sh) <br>
another script i was working on to popout embedded chat & video player <br>
with options of being anonymous, noads, or using your current browser login to get channel points <br>
